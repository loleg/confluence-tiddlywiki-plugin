This plugin for Atlassian Confluence allows users to download the content of a wiki space as a TiddlyWiki that comes ready with plugins that allow synchronization with Confluence.

## About TiddlyWiki ##

A TiddlyWiki is a single, self-contained HTML file that contains data organised in linked sections called tiddlers, which in this case correspond to Confluence pages. It also has script to allow easy viewing, editing, and saving on the desktop, with no network connection required. This makes TiddlyWiki useful for people who need to go on the road with their wikis, or simply for the comfort and assurance of having a private copy to work with.
